### A powerful PDF invoice data extraction tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to parse essential information like invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and contact details from invoices, and stores it in a structured format for analysis.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 Extracts key fields from invoices: invoice numbers, dates, descriptions, amounts, and contact info.
- 💼 Processes multiple PDF files in one go.
- 📝 Outputs structured data in a user-friendly format (Pandas DataFrame).
- 🔒 Keeps your API keys secure with environment variable management.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed on your system. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Key Setup

1. **Generate an OpenAI API Key**: [Get your API Key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. **Create a `.env` File**: In the project root, create a `.env` file and add your API key:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Project

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📝 Usage

1. Place the PDF invoices you want to extract data from in the same directory or specify their path.
2. Run the `main.py` script, which will process the PDF files, extract structured information, and store it in a Pandas DataFrame.

Example output:
```plaintext
Processing invoice.pdf
{
  'Invoice no': '12345',
  'Description': 'Consulting Services',
  'Quantity': '1',
  'Date': '01/01/2024',
  'Unit Price': '500.00',
  'Amount': '500.00',
  'Total': '500.00',
  'Email': 'client@example.com',
  'Phone Number': '1234567890',
  'Address': '123 Main St, Anytown, USA'
}
```

## 📊 Data Extraction Workflow

1. **Load and Split Text**: PDFs are loaded, and text is extracted from each page.
2. **Prompt Preparation**: Text data is fed to OpenAI's GPT-4 with a specific prompt designed to pull the necessary fields.
3. **Structured Output**: The extracted data is processed into a structured format, ideal for further analysis.

## 🔐 Security

API keys are stored securely using environment variables in the `.env` file. Ensure you do not share or expose this file in public repositories.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Environment Variable Issues**: Make sure the `.env` file is in the root directory.
- **OpenAI API Errors**: Check your API key validity and OpenAI usage limits.
